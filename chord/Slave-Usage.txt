How to use a slave server
1. How to produce a SlaveServer.jar
com.puzhen.chord.spark.SlaveServer is the main class for such a server. 
The build snippet is already written in pom.xml. So all you need to do
to produce a SlaveServer.jar is to type `mvn clean compile assembly::single`
in your command line. Make sure you have installed maven.

2. How to use the SlaveServer.jar
Run it with a command line parameter specifying a port number that it
should be listening on. For example,
```
java -jar SlaveServer.jar 8080
```

The command above starts a slave server listening on port 8080.

After starting up, each slave will support two operations: put a key-value
pair and get a value for a given key.

API PUT Request: /put?key=yourkey&value=yourvalue put a key-value pair into the server
API GET Request: /get?key=yourkey will return a value for the key, null if no such key

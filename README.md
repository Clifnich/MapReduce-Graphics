# MapReduce-Graphics
A MapReduce architecture for efficient graphics computing.

Yao Luo's paper made some progress in fastening the graphics computing using Hadoop framework. However his work on this subject is limited to calling a JNI API in Java. We are going to design and implement MapReduce algorithm for the graphics computing with the hope that our work might contribute to the efficiency and accuracy of this field.
